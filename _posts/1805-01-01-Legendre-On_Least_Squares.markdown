##### <center> Abstract </center>
>The great advances in mathematical astronomy made during the early year) of the nineteenth century were due in no small part to the development of the method of least squares. The same method is the foundation for the calculus of errors of observation now occupying a place of great importance in the scientific study of social, economic, biological, and psychological problems. Gauss says in his work on the Theory of ibe Motions oj the Heavenly Bodies (1809) that he had made use of this principle since 1795 but that it was first published by Legendre. The first statement of the method appeared as an appendix entitled "Sur la Methode des moindres quarres" in Legendre's Nouvelles methodes pour la determination des orbites des cometes, Paris, 1805. The portion of the work translated here is found on pages 72-75
