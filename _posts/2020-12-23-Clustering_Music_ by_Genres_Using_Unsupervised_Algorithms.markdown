#### <center> Abstract </center>
> The aim of this study is to detect and contrast genres predefined by Spotify in comparison with unsupervised clustering algorithms. Clearly distinct genres -such as death-metal, Ska and Opera - clustered easily, while some vague musical groupings as jazz, ambient and singer-songwriter did not fit unsupervised groupings based on selected atributes.
