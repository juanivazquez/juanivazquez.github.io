##### <center> Abstract </center>
> This study compares the accuracy of Bayes, Random Forest and Neural Network algorithms for speech recognition. The dataset consists of recordings of numbers from zero to nine --Google Speech Commands Dataset- by different subjects under different background noise conditions. The obtained results confirm that Neural Networks clearly outperformed all other tested algorithms. <br> Index Terms:  *Supervised Learning - Random Forest - Naive Bayes -  Gradient Boosting - Neural Networks* <br> [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MwO2YQds-kYfFlOjMHpdZebDs0OCRsMz/view?usp=sharing)
