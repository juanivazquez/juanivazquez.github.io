#### <div align="center">Abstract
> The current work partially replicates [Tagliazucchi et al](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ChXu95j_SG9dnaRO7qo5lILKtFAFU5W4/view?usp=sharing) for a sample of 18 subjects. Its main goal is to confirm the results previously obtained by the authors with regards to changes in brain activity configuration through sleep stages and wakefulness.
