##### <center> Abstract </center>
> Speech is considered the observable surface revealing the inner thoughts of mind. Thus, thought disorders in psychosis has been related to speech disturbances. New techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), analysis of Speech Graph Attributes (SGA) and Semantic Similarity Cosines have proven to contribute to reach objective and quantifiable measures of pathological speech. This study explores this new techniques usign a dataset provided by the author and pioneer investigator of SGA. The combined techniques outperform the original baseline set in the SGA analysis, indicating integrating different techniques improves predictive quality. <br> Index Terms:  *Speech Graph Attributes - Natural Language Processing - Semantic Similarity Cosine - Naive Bayes* <br> [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N8xTVwuFSp7lgYKKz4mj8BskPuhjIXts/view?usp=sharing)
