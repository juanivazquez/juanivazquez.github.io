##### <center> Abstract </center>
> Theory of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies Moving About the Sun in Conic Sections is a classic scientific work by the renowned mathematician and astronomer Carl Friedrich Gauss. Originally published in 1809, this book is a translation of Gauss's Theoria Motus, which was first published in Latin in 1809. In this work, Gauss presents his mathematical theory of the motion of planets and other celestial bodies in the solar system. He uses conic sections, such as ellipses and hyperbolas, to describe the paths of these bodies as they move around the sun. Gauss's theory is based on his own observations and calculations, as well as the work of other astronomers of his time.The book is divided into three main parts. The first part introduces the mathematical principles and concepts that Gauss uses to describe planetary motion. The second part presents his theory in detail, including his equations and calculations. The third part includes tables of data and other information that astronomers can use to apply Gauss's theory to their own observations.Theory of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies Moving About the Sun in Conic Sections is a landmark work in the history of astronomy and mathematics. Gauss's theory laid the foundation for modern celestial mechanics and his work has had a profound impact on the study of the solar system and beyond. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the history of science, astronomy, or mathematics.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work. <br> Index Terms:  *Time Series* <br> [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZshGEAhnCmJad6pk_9I7M4KWWGeE7u-/view?usp=sharing)
